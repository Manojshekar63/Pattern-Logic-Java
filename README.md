# 🚀 My Coding Journey: Pattern Logic & Beyond

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my growth as a problem solver, shortcut strategist, and logic explorer. This space is more than just code—it's a reflection of how I break down complexity, build reusable methods, and sharpen my skills for competitive programming, interviews, and hackathons.

## 🧠 What This Repo Represents

- 📘 A timeline of my learning—from basic tree structures to advanced logic implementations
- 🧩 A playground for experimenting with pattern problems, recursive thinking, and mental math hacks
- 🛠️ A toolkit of reusable code blocks and shortcut methods for rapid problem solving

## 📂 Current Contents

- `tree.java`: My foundational binary tree implementation
- `subTree_of_another_tree.java`: Recursive logic to check subtree relationships
- More pattern-based problems and logic modules coming soon!

## 🎯 My Goals


- Document my journey for branding, teaching, and future collaborations

## 🛤️ What's Next

- Pattern printing problems (stars, pyramids, numbers)
- Java + Python logic comparisons
- Speed-solving challenges and rapid-fire quizzes
- GitHub repo organization for DSA patterns and branding

## 🤝 Let's Connect

If you're into logic puzzles, shortcut methods, or teaching problem-solving techniques—I'd love to collaborate or exchange ideas. This repo is just the beginning.
